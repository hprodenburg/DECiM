  abstract = {Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a widely used, nondestructive electrochemical technique for analyzing many different systems. Currently, the most popular analysis method for EIS data is via Equivalent Circuit Models (ECMs). Many programs exist for constructing ECMs and fitting them to data, but these programs are often closed-source. In this work, we present an open-source program for equivalent circuit modeling called DECiM, which relies heavily on human input but is easy to operate. With two examples, we show how DECiM can easily and effectively validate spectra and construct and fit ECMs to data. The simple structure and open-source nature of DECiM make implementing new features easy, rendering the program versatile for impedance data analysis.},

The cathodic gas outlet of the cell was closed and impedance measurements were performed at periodic time intervals. Under the experimental conditions{,} the investigated system is far from steady-state conditions. It is shown that enhanced mathematical techniques are required for evaluation of the impedance data obtained. These techniques{,} the time course interpolation as well as the Z-HIT refinement{,} lead to quasi-causal spectra which are well interpreted by means of the porous electrode model.},
