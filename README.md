# DEC*i*M

DEC*i*M (Determination of Equivalent Circuit Models) is an equivalent circuit model fitting program for impedance data. It is a GUI-based program, written entirely in Python.

## Prerequisites

The current DEC*i*M version (1.2.13) requires the following software to already be installed on your computer:

- Python 3.10 or higher (including copy, webbrowser, functools and tkinter as part of the Python Standard Library)
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

Download the entire project. If the prerequisites are already installed, DEC*i*M can be started immediately.

## Usage

Open your preferred program to access the command line and navigate to the `src` directory of the DEC*i*M distribution. Provided your Python installation allows you to run Python 3 as `python`, you can start DEC*i*M from the command line as follows:

```
python DECiM.py
```

For detailed operating instructions, please consult the PDF manual.

## Citing

If you use DEC*i*M for work leading to a scholarly publication, please cite the PDF manual, or cite the publication describing DEC*i*M once it has appeared.
